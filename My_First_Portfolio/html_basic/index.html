    <h3>Why I’m Learning HTML</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>Hello! My name is Ola, and this is my very first webpage. I’m learning HTML to kickstart my journey in web development.</p>
    <p>Building this page is exciting because I get to experiment with headings, paragraphs, and images all in one place.</p>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of the web, and I’m eager to understand how structure and styling work together to create beautiful websites.</p>
    <p>By the end of this project, I’ll have a solid grasp of basic HTML elements and how they’re used in real web pages.</p>
